<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="web-architecture">Web Architecture</h3>
<p>The web application is based on a Service Oriented Application pattern, as a 3-tiered web site application. Presentation layer is realized using Html+Javscript+CSS+Bootstrap web pages, served by the web server at addresses / (home page) and /pages (other pages). Application layer is implemented in Node.js and provides static assets (pages,scripts,styles,media) and application endpoints at address /api. Data layer is implemented using a PostgreSQL DBMS connected to the application server. Application and database servers are both hosted on Heroku and Heroku Postgres PaaS cloud.</p>
<p>Main components which realize the business logic are: Service, Event, Person, Article, Contact</p>

<h3 id="api">API</h3>
<h4 id="rest-compliance">REST compliance</h4>
<p>In the process of creating this Web application we tried to follow as much as possible the principles of a REST API:<br>
-<strong>Uniform interface: </strong>our application is resource based, every resource has a specific URI and provide a way to fetch related and additional data. Every resource is accessible through a common approach, in our case a simple HTTP GET request.<br>
-<strong>Client-Server: </strong>client and server operate and evolve without any dependency on each other. A client is able to get the resource he needs only knowing its URI.<br>
-<strong>Stateless: </strong>the server does not store anything about the latest HTTP request a client makes. Every request is treted as new, so there is no session in the interaction between client and server.<br>
-<strong>Layered system: </strong>the system is layered since the server itself and the "database server" are located in different places but the client cannot tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way.<br>

</p>
<h4 id="openapi-resource-models">OpenAPI Resource models</h4>
<p>Mostly each resource provided by the API can be mapped to one or more database table projected models. For mostly each entity, one projection of the the table is always used: the entity item model, which is used to represent one topic inside one small list element. Each semantic relation request produces only presentation significant data. Each to-n relation request produces an array of items, except for RelatedArticles which incapsulates the array with the subject name. Person and Article are represented using one page, so there is one model representing the page data. Service and Event are two page presented, so there are two models for each presentation projection. Contact and Message can only be read/posted.</p>
<p>Group requests also produces an array, but is also implemented paginating (with fixed limit) and filtering the related table. For example you can search page 2 of a name and month filtered event with the request /events?offset=1&amp;search=name&amp;month=July.</p>
<h3 id="data-model">Data model</h3>
<p>Below the related database tables diagram is presented. Each request minimizes presentation information needed, refining and increasing overall data transmission efficiency as described in previous section.</p>

<ul>
<li>connect: web application framework</li>
<li>swagger-tools: provides a middleware for easy OpenAPI server implementation</li>
<li>js-yaml: for loading .yaml swagger specification</li>
<li>serve-static: provides static assets (html,css,img..) request handling</li>
<li>knex: exposes useful db query methods</li>
<li>pg: provides postgres dbms handling</li>
<li>heroku: handles project deployment on Heroku cloud</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p> <i>How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided OpenAPI specification? Which method did you use to test all APIs endpoints against the expected response?</i><br>
  In development we started with the creation of the OpenAPI specfication, which was then modified when we decided to make a change to the structure. In this way the structure has always remained consistent in all its parts. In our case all the requests made to the server are GET type, so it was very useful to use SwaggerUI to simulate the requests made and verify their correct functioning.<br><br>
  <i>Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to partition a REST-based web application (static assets vs. application data)?</i><br> 
  In our structure we have been very careful to separate the part related to the static assets that are used to build the page (html, js, css) which is located in the web server, with the part related to the data of the application, which instead are only saved in the database and are used to fill the page with information.<br><br>
  <i>Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what are the state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc..).</i><br>
  Our application is stateless, which means that it doesn't need to save any of the interaction between a client and the server for future use.<br><br> 
  <i>Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for managing the data model?</i><br>
  For database management we used PostreSQL, which is a DBMS that refers to a relational structure.<br><br>

<h3 id="analysis-of-existing-api">Analysis of existing API</h3>
<p></p>In the development of our application it was very useful for us to analyze last year's project OpenAPI(<a href="http://hyp-2019-chiappalupi-iannucci.herokuapp.com/docs">http://hyp-2019-chiappalupi-iannucci.herokuapp.com/docs</a>). In particular it has been very useful to understand how to structure the server and above all it has given us many suggestions for improvement that have allowed us to create the complex structure of requests that we have implemented. It was also very useful for the database part as it allowed us to understand how to manage queries in case of offset or limitations on the number of elements to take in the database.
<h3 id="learning-outcome">Learning outcome</h3>
<p>
  This project has covered many areas of IT expertise. As a result, it has been very useful to understand and learn concepts which we never saw or never investigated too much:<br>
-For our designer it was positive to learn how such a project is structured and to get more in touch with the world of computer science by also learning concepts such as SQL.<br>
-For the two engineers it was very interesting to develop a project that put together various concepts that we have been in contact with over the years. Above all to understand how a server is actually structured and how the various requests made to it are handled.
